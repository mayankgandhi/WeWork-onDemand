# WeWork-onDemand

Branch *ProgrammaticUI* Work in progress

This project is a basic MVP version of the Wework OnDemand App. 

On a very high level, It contains 3 main tabs:
  - Search - Where users can look for coworking places to reserve
  - Reservations - Where users can track existing/past/upcoming reservations
  - Profile - Where users can view/edit their credentials and other information
  
This project uses Storyboard to build the structure of the user interface and the coordinator pattern to allow coordination in the SearchViewController.
It is an extremely simplified version of the OnDemand app where the mapView and the collectionview items are hooked and selecting any property will show a detailed view.


# The images used on the app are stock images that are randomly generated with a third party API.
